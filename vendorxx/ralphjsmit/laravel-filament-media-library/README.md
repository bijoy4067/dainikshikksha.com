### Screenshots

#### Library (light and dark mode)

The MediaLibrary page is the page where your users can view all their images. The complete package is compatible with both dark- and lightmode.

#### Upload & bulk upload

Users can drag-and-drop their images unto the upload component. Bulk uploads are allowed. You can use Laravel's queue processing feature to handle the process of generating responsive images in the background.

#### MediaPicker Field & modal

You can use the MediaPicker Field everywhere inside the admin panel where you want it: as a single field or in a repeater. It works everywhere.

When a user clicks on 'Choose image', he/she will see the following modal, which they can use to pick an image.

#### Image detail

For each image, you can edit the caption and the alt-text. You can view the full image URL in the browser and delete images as well.

#### Default theme

By default Filament comes with it's own CSS, which integrates neatly into the admin panel design. However, as I did in the above screenshots, it is just as beautiful if you integrate it with your own Filament theme.

### Upgrading to V2

â€“ The `getImage()` method has been renamed to `getImages()` and the `Illuminate\Support\Collection` return type has been added. If you are extending the MediaPicker component, please update your code accordingly.

- The translation `media.choose-image` now supports a pluralized version: `'choose image|choose images'`. If you created a custom translation, you should update the translation.

### Changelog V2

- Support selecting multiple images in the MediaPicker field.
- Fix issue with green selected border not visible in media library.
- Fix duplicate server requests in Livewire.
- Return type of the `getMedia()` function in the BrowseLibrary class updated to `Illuminate\Contracts\Pagination\Paginator`. If you extended this class and overrided this function, you should update the return type.
